Make study organization and material sharing easier for students and the possibility of sharing sources with their students. 
We help students deal with their lack of motivation and study organization with the help of the SIS integration they can automatically import their subjects and track their progress across semester. 
Students can compare their progress with other students with the goal of increasing their motivation. They can easily filter subjects and have access to more resources.
Students and teachers can share their notes or other materials with their colleagues which makes their study easier.
